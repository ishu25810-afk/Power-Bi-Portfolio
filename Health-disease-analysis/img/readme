# Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard 🫀

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a data-driven analysis of cardiovascular health across a diverse patient population. It identifies key risk factors, demographic trends, and health indicators that contribute to heart disease, offering a visual summary for healthcare professionals or researchers.

## 📊 Key Findings & Insights
* **Patient Demographics:** The analysis covers a comprehensive dataset of patients, segmented by age and gender, to identify the most vulnerable groups.
* **Primary Risk Factors:** High cholesterol levels and elevated blood pressure are identified as the leading indicators for cardiac events.
* **Chest Pain Correlation:** Visual correlations show how different types of chest pain (Asymptomatic vs. Non-anginal) relate to the presence of heart disease.
* **Exercise & Heart Rate:** The data highlights the relationship between maximum heart rate achieved during exercise and the likelihood of heart disease.
* **Diagnostic Indicators:** Metrics like the "ST depression induced by exercise" and "Number of major vessels (colored by fluoroscopy)" are used to predict high-risk cases.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Power BI Desktop:** Used for data cleaning, transformation, and interactive report building.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Utilized to create complex measures for heart disease prevalence rates and average health metrics.
* **Data Visualization:**
    * **Distribution Charts:** For age and gender analysis.
    * **Correlation Plots:** To show the link between blood pressure, cholesterol, and age.
    * **Health KPIs:** Real-time snapshots of average heart rates and risk percentages.

## 📈 Visualizations Included
1. **Health Summary KPIs:** Instant overview of average blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
2. **Gender-Based Risk Analysis:** A breakdown of how heart disease prevalence differs between males and females.
3. **Risk Factor Heatmaps:** Visualizing the intersection of age and major health markers.
4. **Exercise Analysis:** Graphs tracking the impact of physical exertion on cardiac performance indicators.
